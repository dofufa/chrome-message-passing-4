# chrome-message-passing-2
Basic Chrome extension message passing between service worker (as sender) and content script (as receiver)

### Summary


Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This Chrome browser extension example demonstrates simple message passing between two contexts: the **content script** context and the **service worker** context.

```
*********                ***********
*content*<<------message * service *
*script *                * worker  *
*       * response----->>*         *
*********                ***********
receiver                 sender
```
